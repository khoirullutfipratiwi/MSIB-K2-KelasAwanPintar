# Course 1: Python Programming
Python programming is a fundamental skill for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects. Our proficiency in AI will be evaluated, in part, by our ability to write effective and efficient Python code. Python is a popular open-source programming language widely used in AI and ML due to its simple syntax and extensive library support. There are several topics of discussion that are studied in these course, namely:

1. Variable, Basic Data Types, and Operators
2. Containers: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary, and Numpy Array
3. Flow Control: Conditionals and Loops
4. Function and Lambda
5. Object-Oriented Programming
6. File Handling: text, csv, and image file

Upon completion of this in-depth Python course, students should be able to write well-structured and efficient Python code that adheres to best practices. They will be equipped to tackle complex AI projects, demonstrating their ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical problem-solving.
